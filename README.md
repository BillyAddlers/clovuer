# Clovuer
> An extended Vue

Clovuer is a set of tools to guide you in making a Website/WebApp using Vue.
You can start modifying your Vue installation by editing `src/main.ts`.

## Project setup
```shell script
# Preferable method
yarn
# Alternative, if you're using NPM
npm install
```

## Project scripts
Clovuer utilizes vue-cli-service as a baseline for automated process. Any configuration related to vue-cli-services is acceptable.

As vue-cli-service should be, Clovuer uses webpack along with webpack-dev-server for build and development.

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```shell script
yarn run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```shell script
yarn run build
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```shell script
yarn run lint
```
